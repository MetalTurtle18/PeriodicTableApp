# Periodic Table App

This is my APCS final project. It allows the user to view the periodic table of elements in an interactive way. They can be color coded in multiple different ways. The user can click on every element to view more information about it.

## Instructions

* Start the program by running `Main.main()`
* In the periodic table window you can:
  * Click on an element to view its information. Click on the element in the information panel to return to the periodic table.
  * Click on the "Metal Types" button to color elements by metal, nonmetal, and metalloid.
  * Click on the "Element Groups" button to color elements by more specific groupings.
  * Click on the "Electronegativity" button to color elements based on their electronegativity.
  * Click on the "Element Song" button to play the [elements song by Tom Lehrer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGM-wSKFBpo).
* Keyboard shortcuts:
  * On the main page:
    * Press `M` to switch to metal coloring
    * Press `G` to switch to group coloring
    * Press `E` to switch to electronegativity coloring
    * Press `S` to play and stop the elements song
  * On an info page:
    * Press `B` to go back to the main page
    * Press the left arrow key to go to the previous element
    * Press the right arrow key to go to the next element
